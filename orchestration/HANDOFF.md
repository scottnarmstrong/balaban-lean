# Orchestrator handoff (Balaban campaign, phase 1)

Written 2026-10-12 ~06:45 UTC by the orchestrator session scott-41 (account claude-2, weekly quota
nearly exhausted). A new orchestrator session should read AGENTS.md, this file, and the last ~60 rows of
`orchestration/LEDGER.md`, then continue. Policies: at most 4 Sonnet + 1 Opus subagents, no
sub-subagents ("Do not launch subagents" in every brief), hard rules of AGENTS.md verbatim in every brief
(including rule 9: never kill processes you did not start). Heavy mathematics goes to astra
(codex, GPT-6-Sol xhigh, in tmux), Lean to Sonnet workers in worktrees.

## Landing procedure (unchanged)

1. Read the worker's handoff; `git diff --stat origin/main...HEAD`, grep new files for
   `sorry|^axiom|maxHeartbeats`.
2. Axiom probe in the worktree: a scratch `AxWnn.lean` with `import Balaban` and `#print axioms` of the
   main theorems (correct namespace!), `lake env lean AxWnn.lean`, then delete it. Do this BEFORE land.sh.
3. `cd /home/scott/Balaban && set -o pipefail && scripts/land.sh <branch> "<msg>" | tail -3` — use
   `pipefail` so a refusal is not masked; land.sh refuses if main has uncommitted changes outside notes/.
4. `git worktree remove --force /home/scott/Balaban-worktrees/Wnn && git branch -D <branch>`.
5. Ledger row; commit + push.
Worktree setup: `git worktree add -q <path> -b <branch>`, `mkdir -p <path>/.lake`,
`cp .lake/package-overrides.json <path>/.lake/`, `cp -a .lake/build <path>/.lake/`,
`(cd <path> && elan override set ocreg-throttled)`.

## Running at handoff

Sonnet (background subagents of scott-41; they die with the session — if so, restart from the brief
in the ledger row and the branch state):
- W70: DONE (landed 017b7c9; χ^dom identity still open).


- W75: DONE (landed d6829a5).
- W81: DONE (landed 6dd2084; χ^dom identity false as formalized → queued item 8).
- W76: DONE (landed c9ac759).
- W79: DONE (landed dd7b11e).
- W80: DONE (landed; bridgeInf gives PremisesCore ∧ SumConds from the class).
- W77: DONE (landed 7c6b40b).
- W82: DONE (landed; Q1 complete, Q5/Q6 blocked on an under-specified Def II.7.6 → queued item 9).
- W78: DONE (landed c6f82f7).

astra (tmux sessions `astra-<name>`, scratch dirs /home/scott/Balaban-scratch/astra-<name>/, all on
codex-1; each prints "<TAG> DONE"; results are copied into notes/phase1/ and committed). Round 3
(sent ~07:30 UTC):
- astra-kf0: followup3.txt — choose Route H (high-mass extension of BG Thm 5.2 / H7 / base step /
  LF-8) or Route D (direct one-scale) and prove its first missing piece; LF-BASE-KF0 Part D. Tag KF0D.
- astra-class: followup1.txt — I6-ANISO.md (anisotropic I-6, Lean-ready). Tag I6ANISO.
- astra-vmod: followup2.txt — VMOD-3.md: prove the Dec2 `CoverGeom`/`CoverBase.nc`/`CoverLocal`
  fields for the mixed pairs (OPEN-NC3-MIXED-WALL, OPEN-EMBED-MIXED, OPEN-BLOCKCOUNT-MINIMAL). Tag VMOD3.
- astra-rgfree: followup2.txt — RGFREE-3.md: FREE-LOC, SWITCH-LOC, SWITCH-H7. Tag RGFREE3.
- astra-fluctfix: followup2.txt — FLUCTUATION v2.2: Theorem 3.1(f) in full. Tag FLUCTFIX3.
- astra-basek (new, prompt.txt): BASE-KERNEL.md — k=0 kernel factor list, C^{(0)}, H, b₀, baseMainAction, (S5), proofs of II.7.7/II.7.8 (unblocks queued item 9). Tag BASEK.
If a session shows "Selected model is at capacity", resend the one-line pointer message.
Sending to a codex TUI: `tmux send-keys -t S -l "<one line>"; tmux send-keys -t S Enter`
(long pastes get truncated — always point to a file).

## Queued Lean packages (in rough priority)

0. (new) I-5 with ψ′ (VMOD order 7) on the landed Dec2 layer, conditional on `CoverLocal` instances
   for the mixed pairs (theorem hypotheses = the instance; fields proved later from VMOD-3).

1. W78 DecCover abstraction (VMOD §3.2–3.3, orders 2, 4, 5): `DecCover C`, `CoverCompatible C H`,
   generalize DG/I-4a by hypotheses, concrete wrapper C = H. 3.5k–6k lines.
2. Def-6 amendments per CLASS-RULINGS (accepted): `momentSum` → `Edens`; `pavingSymGroup` +
   `fullJSymGroup`, `eucEloc/eucMloc`; thermodynamic (H.5) on an infinite-volume family T∞
   (stabilization + tail bound); Reynolds average over paving offsets; redirect the bridge
   (`Def6Bridge*`) to T∞.
3. Anisotropic I-6 rework once I6-ANISO.md lands (replace isotropic Tube premises by XiDom + radius
   ε_j; RenormSmall/RenormIso/RenormTermwiseIrrel).
4. LF `DmodOmega`: use nearest-neighbour components `nnComp` (CLASS-RULINGS Q-E), keep `starComp`.
5. Wire FLUCT Lemma 2.5 (`chiFl_absorbs_of`) to W71/W73 results after FLUCT v2.1 fixes the constants.
6. FLUCT modules 11 (Renorm, Lemma 3.5, Thm 3.1(g),(h)), 13 (Lemma 4.1), 14 (Switch scalar part);
   LFR Part III blocks P1–P16 (none started), Q1, Q5–Q7 after W77.
7. Doc touch-up: LFR IV.1.3 prefactor per FLUCT v2 FL-A04.
9. Base step Q5/Q6: needs an astra reconstruction of the k=0 kernel factor by factor (P5 (2.47) × P6 (3.2) at k=0: cube sets for P/Q/R/S, which bonds belong to the kernel, ψ′₀ factors), C^{(0)1/2}_loc and H, the explicit b₀; a `baseMainAction` with the spin-gradient energy on Λ₀. Then Q5/Q6 in Lean.
8. LF localized-field domain fix (W81 item 3): `subMultiscaleField` vs `genBlocksIn` on localized histories; decide the definition change (level-k field on the V-support, or restrict genBlocksIn to the component), then prove the χ^dom identity. Also `quietKernel_euclid` (II.5.10 lattice part; several thousand lines).

## Waiting on Scott

- Second-freeze proposal `notes/phase1/SURFACE-V2-PROPOSAL.md`.
- Roland questions (merges, small-field pockets, kernel locality, β-dependence; OBSERVABLES §6).
